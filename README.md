System Analysis and Design

•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for DriverPass is for people who are learning to drive. The system is designed to take new drivers and give them all the chances to succeed. Including in person driving and online tests.

•	What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well in Project one where I needed to create the Business Requirements Document.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the System Design Document because it feels sloppy looking over it a second time. Now with more knowledge from class, I can see by cleaning it up and giving more detailed summary will make a huge difference.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Considering the users’ needs is crucial for a project like this. For example, if you have a group of people moving your stuff and you explained to them that all the breakables need to be wrapped up and they just throw it all in a box instead, how would that make you feel? Listening to all the needs the user wants can make software something that lives or dies. 

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software from a time consuming but effective way. I start by trying to break down each part into sections like an “outline”. This helps me to analyze the design and gives me more information while allowing me think about how to solve the problem at play. Then I start a rough graph (pseudocode). Finally I rewrite the pseudocode code into real code to bring the software to life.
